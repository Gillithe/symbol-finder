Symbol Finder is a simple extension that helps you find and copy any desired HTML5 symbol from the toolbar popup UI.

Simply open the UI and click on the desired category from the drop-down list at the top. Or, type a search keyword to see all matched symbols. To copy a symbol, please click on the individual icons to see details at the bottom of the UI (the icon will be copied to the clipboard automatically). There are more than 65000 icons available to choose from. Please note that within the search bar, as you type a word, icons will appear on the fly.

By default, only the most common symbols are loaded. If you want to load all 65000, please press the - Load Extra - button in the UI. Also, note that loading all icons may slow down the browser as the list is very large. Please load the complete list only if you need all icons, otherwise, use the default list.

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
